### Projects
- **[Password Manager](https://github.com/Srikar25/Password-Manager)**
This **Password Manager** is a secure and user-friendly application designed to help users generate, store, and retrieve strong passwords efficiently. Built using **Tkinter** for the GUI and **SQLite** for local storage, it ensures password security by encrypting them with **AES encryption (Fernet)**. Unlike traditional password managers, it does not store plaintext passwords in the database; instead, passwords are decrypted only when needed, enhancing security. With features like **search, delete, and password retrieval on demand**, this tool provides a reliable solution for managing credentials safely.
